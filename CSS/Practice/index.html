                    Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. This
                    is enabled by Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface
                    water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's
                    crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of
                    continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and
                    covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than
                    Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly
                    moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth
                    has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the destructive
                    solar winds and cosmic radiation.
